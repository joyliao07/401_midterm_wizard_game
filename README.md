# PhotoQuest (0.0.0)
The wizard needs your help - he needs to fight the evil dragon, but he forgot what the tool for his latest spell looks like. Take pictures of what his tool looks like and the wizard will award you with points - compete with your friends for top points.

## Overview
Users are given a randomized prompt consisting of a few keywords (e.g. "blue sports car and a person"). When they submit a photo that they believe fills those keywords, it is evaluated by google vision API and the returned tags are matched against the prompt. When the prompt is fulfilled, points are awarded and a new prompt is generated.
  
Users have a unique login where their own points are tracked.
  
## Stretch goals
- video game-styled UI with characters.
- make it a social game. Users share the same prompt and only the winning user is awarded points. Photos are posted into a public feed.
- look at photo headers to determine that the photo was taken the same day (to avoid cheating)
- add a report feature in case it's obvious the photo is just a stock photo
